  * A user requests to change the bot's language, bot replies to the request with a keyboard to select the new language.

  *
  * @param keyboard        Sequence of button rows, each represented by an Array of KeyboardButton objects
  * @param resizeKeyboard  Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically for optimal fit

  *                        Defaults to false, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the same height as the app's standard keyboard.
  * @param oneTimeKeyboard Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it's been used. Defaults to false.
  * @param selective       Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard to specific users only.

/**
  * Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user

  * This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice privacy mode.
  *
  * '''Example:'''
  * A poll bot for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions).
  * There could be two ways to create a new poll:
  * Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2).
  * May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
  * Guide the user through a step-by-step process.
  * 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options,
  * then send /done when you're ready'.
  *
  * The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use ForceReply in your bot's questions, it will receive
  * the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.
  *
  * @param forceReply Shows reply interface to the user, as if they manually selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'
